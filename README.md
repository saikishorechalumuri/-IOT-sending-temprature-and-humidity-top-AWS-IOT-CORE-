In this project,IAM SENDING MY DHT22 SENSOR DATA INTO AWS IOT CORE BY USING MQTT PROTOCOL and checking it in the test client provided by amazon web services In this project I came to know about AWS IOT CORE SETUP PROCESS USING MQTT PROTOCOL

STEPS BEFORE GOING INTO THE CODE 1)Signing up & setting the Amazon Web Services 2)Installing Necessary Libraries to Arduino IDE & Writing an Arduino Sketch for the project 3)Creating a Thing is AWS 4)Creating Policy and attaching to Thing 5)Generating Certificates 6)Modifying Arduino Sketch according to Thing Data & Credentials 7)Subscribe & Publish Data to and from AWS Dashboard

MAKE A NOTE WHEN YOUR COMPIKING OR UPLOADING THE FILE IN AURDINO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE THE DATA FOLDER IN YOUR CODE FOLDER
